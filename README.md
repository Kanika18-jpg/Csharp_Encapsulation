# Csharp_Encapsulation

Read-only properties in C# are properties that have a getter but no setter. They allow you to expose a property from a class that can be read by external code
but cannot be modified or set from outside the class. Read-only properties are a way to provide controlled access to the data within a class while preventing 
direct modification.
